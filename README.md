# Interactive Map Application

This is an interactive map application that allows users to plan driving routes with multiple stops, including draggable routes, customizable stop durations, and real-time travel calculations. Users can save and load routes, calculate travel time, and display the total trip duration in both minutes and "hours and minutes" format. The application also provides a summary of travel distance, travel time, and stopover time. Presently, the app is set up to operate as a local html file and requires a Google Maps Platform API Key. Future versions will include online access.

## ABOUT. This is a very simple app. I am sharing it in hopes of building on it and building connections and community. I chose the AGPLV3 license as I am also working to build a very comprehensive Real Estate Appraisal analysys software that I would also like to have all or part built in an open-source copy left environment. Because of the commitment required and the limited number of users, I don't believe a fully open-source license will suit that application. So I am just experimenting with this mapping application for fun really.


## Features
- **Draggable Routes**: Users can manually drag and adjust the routes on the map.
- **Customizable Stops**: Add multiple stops with custom stopover durations.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Automatically calculate travel time, stop durations, and total trip duration.
- **Save and Load Routes**: Save your routes to local storage and load them for future use.
- **Detailed Summary**: Provides a summary of total travel distance, total travel time, stopover time, and total trip duration in an easy-to-read format.
- **Internet required** for initial loading. Once loaded, the map can be viewed while start times, and stopovers can be updated even if there is no internet connection.
